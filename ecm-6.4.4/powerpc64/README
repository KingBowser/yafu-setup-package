mulredc[1..20].asm are size-specific asm functions for mulredc.
Sizes 1 and 2 may be regenerated by the m4 script mulredc_1_2.m4. 
Sizes 3 through 20 may be regenerated by the m4 script mulredc.m4. 
This generation is not done automatically with the autoconf/automake
stuff.

If you need to regenerate them, the syntax is

(for 1 and 2)
  m4 -DLENGTH=1 mulredc_1_2.m4 > mulredc1.asm
  m4 -DLENGTH=2 mulredc_1_2.m4 > mulredc2.asm

(for 3 through 20)
  m4 -DLENGTH=3 mulredc.m4 > mulredc3.asm
  m4 -DLENGTH=4 mulredc.m4 > mulredc4.asm
  ...
etc., up to LENGTH=20.

If you have problems, you should reconfigure with the --disable-asm-redc 
option.

redc.asm is a version of redc separated from the multiplication, since
there are cases where it is needed.

test_mulredc.c, bench.c and the Makefile.dev are for development.
