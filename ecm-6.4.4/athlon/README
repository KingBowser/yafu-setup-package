mulredc[1..20].s are size-specific asm code for mulredc.
These are generated by the Python script autogen.py. In order to avoid
dependency of the package to Python, this generation is not done
automatically with the autoconf/automake stuff.

If you need to regenerate them, the syntax is
  ./autogen.py 3 > mulredc3.s
And you can generate all of them with the shell script 
  ./generate_all

This asm code uses no MMX/SSE2 instructions and should work on any x86
computers. 

redc.asm is a version of redc separated from the multiplication, since
there are cases where it is needed.

test_mulredc.c, bench.c and the Makefile are for developpement.
