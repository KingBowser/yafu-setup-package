mulredc[1..20].asm are size-specific asm functions for mulredc.
These are generated by the Python autogen.py script (old version, still
used for sizes 1 and 2) and the m4 script mulredc.m4 (all other sizes). 
In order to avoid dependency on the Python and m4 packages, this generation 
is not done automatically with the autoconf/automake stuff.

If you need to regenerate them, the syntax is
  ./autogen.py 1 > mulredc1.asm
  ./autogen.py 2 > mulredc2.asm
  m4 -DLENGTH=3 mulredc.m4 > mulredc3.asm
  m4 -DLENGTH=4 mulredc.m4 > mulredc4.asm
etc., up to LENGTH=20.

If you have problems, you should reconfigure with the --disable-asm-redc 
option.

redc.asm is a version of redc separated from the multiplication, since
there are cases where it is needed.

test_mulredc.c, bench.c and the Makefile.dev are for development.
